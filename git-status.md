***Definition: git-status*** The git-status command is a useful tool in Git version control system. It allows users to view the current status of their working directory by showing the differences between the working directory and the latest commit in the repository. This command provides an overview of any changes made, such as new, modified, or deleted files, as well as files staged for commit.

The git-status command is beneficial for understanding which changes have been made and ensuring that the correct files are staged for the next commit. It also helps users stay organized and aware of the current state of their repository.

To access the same information provided by the git-status command in JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal, you can use the Git extension for JupyterLab allowing you to view the repository's status by clicking on the Git icon.
